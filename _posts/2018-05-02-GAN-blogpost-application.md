# Introduction
In previous lessons, we have seen different types of neural networks that solve **classification problems.** Convolutional neural networks are well-suited for spatial data, making them a good choice for image classification. Recurrent neural networks are well-suited for sequential data, and thus are good for classifying English sentences as gramatically correct or incorrect. As we will see, generative adversarial networks (GANs) utilize these classification capabilities in a clever way to extend the applications of machine learning.

Specifically, GANs have the ability to generate new data. For example, they allow us to generate images of dogs. Going a step further, it is even possible to specify what type of dog: fur color, size, perpective angle, etc. More formally, traditional neural networks take in high-dimensional input data **X** and return a low-dimensional output **Y**, such as a number in the range **[0,1]**. GANs do the opposite: given **Y**, its goal is to output a possible **X** such that, when fed into a traditional network, it would classify it with the value **Y**.
